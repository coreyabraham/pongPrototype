# Pong Prototype (Raylib C / C++)

A simple pong prototype done with Raylib C / C++ for a school project!
There's not really much else to it honestly.

# Keybindings

```
Q = Move Up
A = Move Down
Left ALT = Slow Down
```

> Player 2:
```
P = Move Up
L = Move Down
Right ALT = Slow Down
```

Backspace = Exit to Title Screen (Only works during Match!)
```

## Building / Compiling

To use this project, you must have Visual Studio installed with C/C++ development tools and this github project cloned in order to build and compile your own variant of this project!

Basically your typical C/C++ Visual Studio project, that's all you really need to know besides the useage of Raylib's C/C++ Header.
