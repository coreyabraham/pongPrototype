## Building / Compiling

To use this project, you must have Visual Studio installed with C / C++ development tools and this github project cloned in order to build and compile your own variant of this project!
Basically your typical C / C++ Visual Studio project, that's all you really need to know besides the useage of Raylib's C / C++ Header.
